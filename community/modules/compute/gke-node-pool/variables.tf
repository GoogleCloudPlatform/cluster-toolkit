  Sets the number of threads per physical core. By setting threads_per_core
  to 2, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) is enabled extending the total number
  of virtual cores. For example, a machine of type c2-standard-60 will have 60
  virtual cores with threads_per_core equal to 2. With threads_per_core equal
  to 1 (SMT turned off), only the 30 physical cores will be available on the VM.

  The default value of \"0\" will turn off SMT for supported machine types, and
  will fall back to GCE defaults for unsupported machine types (t2d, shared-core
  instances, or instances with less than 2 vCPU).

  Disabling SMT can be more performant in many HPC workloads, therefore it is
  disabled by default where compatible.

  null = SMT configuration will use the GCE defaults for the machine type
  0 = SMT will be disabled where compatible (default)
  1 = SMT will always be disabled (will fail on incompatible machine types)
  2 = SMT will always be enabled (will fail on incompatible machine types)
