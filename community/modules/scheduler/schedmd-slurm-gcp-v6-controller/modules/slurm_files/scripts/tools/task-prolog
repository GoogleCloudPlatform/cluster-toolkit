# Main TaskProlog Script
# This script executes all *.sh scripts found in /slurm/custom_scripts/task_prolog.d/
#
# slurm.conf configuration:
# TaskProlog=/slurm/scripts/tools/task-prolog

# Directory containing the individual task prolog scripts
PROLOG_D_DIR="/slurm/custom_scripts/task_prolog.d"

# --- Output Handling for TaskProlog ---
# Slurm's TaskProlog can interpret specific stdout lines:
# - "export NAME=value" : Sets an environment variable for the task.
# - "unset NAME"         : Unsets an environment variable for the task.
# - "print message"      : Prints a message to the task's standard output.
#
# This wrapper script will concatenate the stdout of all sub-scripts.
# If sub-scripts need to set/unset environment variables or print messages
# for the task, they should output the appropriate "export", "unset", or "print"
# commands to their own stdout.

# --- Error Handling ---
# If any script in PROLOG_D_DIR exits with a non-zero status,
# this main script will also exit with a non-zero status.
# This will typically cause the task to fail.
set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# Check if the directory exists
if [[ ! -d "$PROLOG_D_DIR" ]]; then
  # Log in task stdout and exit if the directory is missing. All jobs will be failed.
  echo "print TaskProlog Error: Directory '$PROLOG_D_DIR' not found. Check Slurm configuration."
  exit 1
fi

# Find and execute all *.sh scripts in the directory
# Scripts will be executed in reverse alphabetical order of their filenames.

    # Execute the script. Its stdout will be captured by this wrapper.
    # Its stderr will also be passed through.
    # If a sub-script exits with an error, 'set -e' will cause this wrapper to exit.
