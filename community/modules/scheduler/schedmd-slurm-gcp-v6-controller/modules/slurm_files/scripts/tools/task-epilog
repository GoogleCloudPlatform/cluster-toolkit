# Main TaskEpilog Script
# This script executes all *.sh scripts found in /slurm/custom_scripts/task_epilog.d/
#
# slurm.conf configuration:
# TaskEpilog=/slurm/scripts/tools/task-epilog

# Directory containing the individual task epilog scripts
EPILOG_D_DIR="/slurm/custom_scripts/task_epilog.d"

# --- Output Handling for TaskEpilog ---
# The stdout and stderr of this script (and the sub-scripts it calls)
# are typically captured by Slurm and written to the job's output/error file
# or a separate Slurm log, depending on configuration.
# Unlike TaskProlog, stdout is not typically parsed for special commands
# like 'export' or 'print' to affect the (now finished) task's environment.
#
# --- Error Handling ---
# If any script in EPILOG_D_DIR exits with a non-zero status,
# this main script will also exit with a non-zero status.
# Slurm will log this. Depending on Slurm's configuration,
# frequent epilog failures might lead to node issues or alerts.
set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# Check if the directory exists
if [[ ! -d "$EPILOG_D_DIR" ]]; then
  # Log in task stdout and exit if the directory is missing. This likely indicates a configuration error.
  echo "print TaskEpilog Error: Directory '$EPILOG_D_DIR' not found. Check Slurm configuration."
  exit 1

# Find and execute all *.sh scripts in the directory
# Scripts will be executed in reverse alphabetical order of their filenames.

    # Its stderr will also be passed through.
    # If a sub-script exits with an error, 'set -e' will cause this wrapper to exit.
