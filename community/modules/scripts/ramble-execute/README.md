## Description

This module will create a startup-script runner that will execute Ramble commands.

Ramble is a multi-platform experimentation framework capable of driving
software installation, acquiring input files, configuring experiments, and
extracting results. For more information about Ramble, see:
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ramble

This module outputs a startup script runner, which can be combined with other
startup script runners to execute a set of Ramble commands.

Ramble makes extensive use of Spack. It must be installed with a Toolkit runner
generated by the [spack-setup module](../spack-setup/README.md) following the
[basic example](#basic-example) below.

> **_NOTE:_** This is an experimental module and the functionality and
> documentation will likely be updated in the near future. This module has only
> been tested in limited capacity.

# Examples

## Basic Example

Below is a basic example of using this module.

```yaml
  - id: spack
    source: community/modules/scripts/spack-setup

  - id: ramble-setup
    source: community/modules/scripts/ramble-setup

  - id: ramble-execute
    source: community/modules/scripts/ramble-execute
    use: [spack, ramble-setup]
    settings:
      commands:
      - ramble list
```

This example shows installing Spack and Ramble with their own modules
(spack-setup and ramble-setup respectively). Then the ramble-execute module
is added to simply list all applications Ramble knows about.
