## Description

**THIS MODULE IS PRE-RELEASE AND DOES NOT YET SUPPORT A FULLY FUNCTIONAL
HTCONDOR POOL**

This module creates a Toolkit runner that will install HTCondor on RedHat 7 or
derivative operating systems such as the CentOS 7 release in the [HPC VM
Image][hpcvmimage].

It also exports a list of Google Cloud APIs which must be enabled prior to
provisioning an HTCondor Pool.

## Important note

This module enables Linux firewall rules that block access to the instance
metadata server for any POSIX user that is not `root` or `condor`. This prevents
user jobs from being able to escalate privileges to act as the VM. System
services and HTCondor itself can continue to do so, such as writing to Cloud
Logging. This [feature can be disabled](#input_block_metadata_server).
