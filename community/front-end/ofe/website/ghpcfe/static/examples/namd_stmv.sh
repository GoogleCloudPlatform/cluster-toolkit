# CHANGES REQUIRED TO SPACK PACKAGE FOR CHARMPP
#     https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/18535
# then...
# spack install namd @2.15a1 fftw=mkl ^charmpp backend=mpi arch=cascadelake
#
# ALSO, the NAMD package assumes that 'intel-mkl' sets up include directories like Spack expects
# It does not.
# Just yum install fftw-devel so that it can find an fftw3.h header...
