# Building Apptainer (SIF) Images Interactively

The [builder.yaml](builder.yaml) HPC Toolkit blueprint creates a Google Cloud instance with Apptainer installed that you can use to interactively build SIF images.

## Deploy

Make a copy of the `build.yaml` file, e.g., 

```cp build.yaml mybuild.yaml```

Then edit it to set the `project_id` field appropriately. Now you can create the deployment artifacts with the command

```./ghpc create mybuild.yaml```

You should see output that looks like

```
To deploy your infrastructure please run:

./ghpc deploy bldtainer

Find instructions for cleanly destroying infrastructure and advanced manual
deployment instructions at:

bldtainer/instructions.txt
```

Enter ```./ghpc deploy bldtainer``` to deploy the Apptainer build instance.

## Develop

### Log In and Verify

Log into the build instance using the command

```bash
gcloud compute ssh bldtainer-0 --zone us-central1-a --tunnel-through-iap
```

On the build instance check to ensure Apptainer is installed using the command

```bash
apptainer
```

You should see output that looks like

```

### Create a Simple SIF Image

Apptainer builds SIF images from a [definition file](https://apptainer.org/user-docs/3.8/definition_files.html). Use this command to create a definition file for a simple SIF image

```bash
cat <<- "EOF" > lolcow.def
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:20.04

%post
    apt-get update -y
    apt-get -y install cowsay lolcat

%environment
    export LC_ALL=C
    export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH

%runscript
    date | cowsay | lolcat
EOF
```

Now use the `apptainer build` command to create a SIF image

```bash
apptainer build lolcow.sif lolcow.def
```

This will generate many lines of output

```

You can execute the `lolcow.sif` file via the `apptainer run` command

```bash
apptainer run lolcow.sif
```

or just enter `./lolcow.sif`

In either case you should see output similar to

```

## Publish

Containers package software and dependencies so that they can be easily shared and deployed. One of the most effective ways to share containers is through _repositories_. Google Cloud provides [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) which stores, manages, and secures build artifacts - including containers. SIF images can be stored in Artifact Registry using the [OCI Registry As Storage](https://oras.land/) (oras) scheme. Slurm jobs running in an HPC Toolkit deployed cluster can pull the SIF images they need from Artifact Registry as they need them.

If you don't have an Artifact Registry repository available follow the steps [here](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos#description) to create one. The create an environment variable for your repository URL

```bash
export REPOSITORY_URL=<ARTIFACT REGISTRY REPOSITORY URL> # e.g. oras://us-docker.pkg.dev/myproject/sifs
```

Apptainer needs to authenticate to your repository before it can push or pull images. Use this command to authenticate

```bash
apptainer remote login \
--username=oauth2accesstoken \
--password=$(gcloud auth print-access-token) \ 
oras://${REPOSITORY_URL}
```

You should see output like

```
INFO:    Token stored in /home/joeuser/.apptainer/remote.yaml
```

Push the `lolcow.sif` container image to Artifact Registry using the command

```bash
apptainer push lolcow.sif ${REPOSITORY_URL}/lolcow:1.0
```

Which will generate out put like

```
82.6MiB / 82.6MiB [================================================================================] 100 % 141.8 MiB/s 0s
82.6MiB / 82.6MiB [================================================================================] 100 % 141.8 MiB/s 0s
INFO:    Upload complete
```

Now you can delete the SIF image you built with

```bash
rm lolcow.sif
```

and then retrieve it using the command

```bash
apptainer pull ${REPOSITORY_URL}/lolcow:1.0
```

with output similar to

```
INFO:    Downloading oras image
403.0b / 403.0b [===============================================================================================] 100 %0s
82.6MiB / 82.6MiB [================================================================================] 100 % 105.0 MiB/s 0s
```

The image you pulled with be named `lolcow_1.0.sif`

## Cleanup

When you have finished defining and building containers log out of the `bldtainer-0` instance and destroy it using with

```bash
./ghpc destroy bldtainer
```
