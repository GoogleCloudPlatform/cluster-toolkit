# Apptainer Enabled Slurm Clusters

The HPC Toolkit streamlines the definition and deployment of HPC Systems via _blueprints_ that it uses to generate and deploy [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configurations. Here we provide two example blueprints that build custom [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) enabled images for use in the HPC system configuration created by the HPC Toolkit `ghpc` command line tool. The blueprints are:
- [slurm-apptainer.yaml](./slurm-apptainer.yaml)
- [slurm-apptainer-gpu.yaml](./slurm-apptainer-gpu.yaml)
