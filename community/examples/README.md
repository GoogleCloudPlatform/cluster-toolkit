# Example Blueprints

This directory contains blueprints contributed externally by the community.
These can be used by the Toolkit to provision your infrastructure.

They are documented in the [the core examples folder](../../examples/README.md)
along with [community support guidelines](../../examples/README.md#blueprint-descriptions).
