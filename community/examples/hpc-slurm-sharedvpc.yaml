blueprint_name: hpc-slurm-legacy-sharedvpc

# IMPORTANT NOTES
#
# 1. This blueprint expects a Shared VPC to exist and has already been shared
#    from a Host project to a Service project.
# 2. It also anticipates that the custom steps for provisioning a Filestore
#    instance in a Shared VPC in a service project have been completed:
#
#    https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/shared-vpc
#
# 3. Replace project_id, host_project_id, network_name, subnetwork_name with
#    valid values in your environment

vars:
  project_id:  ## Set GCP Project ID Here ##
  host_project_id: your-host-project
  deployment_name: hpc-small-shared-vpc
  region: us-central1
  zone: us-central1-c
