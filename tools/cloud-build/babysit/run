    I'm -1 on this and on any other proposed twiddlings of the __main__ machinery. 
    The only use case seems to be running scripts that happen to be living inside a 
    module's directory, which I've always seen as an antipattern. 
    To make me change my mind you'd have to convince me that it isn't.
                            Probably Guido van Rossum

    Usage:
    $ tools/cloud-build/babysit/run --pr #### --auto
