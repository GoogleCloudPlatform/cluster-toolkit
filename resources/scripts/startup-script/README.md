## Description
This resource creates startup scripts by chaining together a list runners. Each runner receives the following attributes:
- `destination`: (Required) The name of the file at the destination VM. If a path if provided, the file will be copied at that path, otherwise, the file will be created in a temporary folder and deleted once the startup script runs.
- `type`: (Required) The type of the runner, one of the following:
  - `shell`: The runner is a shell script and will be executed once copied to the destination VM.
  - `ansible-local`: The runner is an ansible playbook, and will run with `ansible-playbook --connection=local --inventory=localhost, --limit localhost <destination>`. Ansible must be previously installed in this VM (for instance [with a previous runner](examples/install_ansible.sh)).
  - `data`: The data specified will be copied to `<destination>`. No action will be performed after the data is staged.
- `content`: (Optional) Data as `string` to be uploaded. Must be defined if `source` is not. This data can be used by subsequent runners or simply made available on the VM for later use.
- `source`: (Optional) A path to the file or data you want to upload. Must be defined if `content` is not. The source path is relative to the resource group directory in the blueprint. Scripts distributed as part of modules should start with modules/ followed by the name of the module used (not to be confused with the resource ID) and the path to the script. Examples shown below. To reference any other source file, an absolute path must be used.
- `args`: (Optional) Arguments to be passed to shell scripts. This will not be used for other runner types.

Runners will be uploaded to a [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets). This bucket will be created by this resource and named as `${var.deployment_name}-startup-scripts-${random_id}`.  VMs using the startup script created by this resource will pull the runners content from a GCS bucket and therefore must have access to GCS.

For more information on how to use startup scripts on Google Cloud Platform, please refer to [this document](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts/linux).

To debug startup scripts from a Linux VM created with startup script generated by this module:
```
sudo DEBUG=1 google_metadata_script_runner startup
```

To view ouputs from a Linux startup script, run:
```
sudo journalctl -u google-startup-scripts.service
```
