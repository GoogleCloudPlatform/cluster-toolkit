#######  CAE Solution Blueprint #######
#           ****************
#
# This blueprint features a reference design suited for CAE applications on GCP.
# It sets up the following infrastructure:
#   * Google's H3 VMs, ideally suited for CAE workloads
#   * Google's C3-highmem VM, suited for workloads with 16GB/core requirement
#   * Google's Filestore NFS-based shared storage
#   * Google's Chrome Remote Desktop
#   * SLURM workload scheduler

# remote desktop partition and connects to the previously set up
# NFS shares.

- group: cluster
  modules:

  #######  Scratch #######
  # This block creates an NFS file share for scratch. If you experience an IO bottleneck,
  # consider to use the more performant version HIGH_SCALE_SSD with the following settings:
  - id: scratchfs
    source: modules/file-system/filestore
    use: [network1]
    settings:
      filestore_tier: HIGH_SCALE_SSD
      size_gb: 10240    # smallest size for HIGH_SSD_SCALE
      filestore_share_name: scratchshare
      local_mount: /scratch

  # If you require maximum IO performance, you can consider to bring up a dedicated parallel
  # file system, e.g. DDN Exascaler Lustre, Sycomp GPFS, or Intel DAOS.
  # Note: Those solutions may have associated license cost.
