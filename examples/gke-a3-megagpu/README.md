Refer to [Deploy an A3 Mega GKE cluster for ML training](https://cloud.google.com/cluster-toolkit/docs/deploy/deploy-a3-mega-gke-cluster) for instructions on creating the GKE-A3M cluster.

Refer to [Deploy and run NCCL test with Topology Aware Scheduling (TAS)](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/create/gke-ai-hypercompute#deploy-run-nccl-tas-test) for instructions on running a NCCL test on the GKE-A3M cluster.

### Additional Consumption Options
The Cluster Toolkit supports alternative consumption options such as Spot VMs or Dynamic Workload Scheduler (DWS) Flex-start.
Refer to step 5 of [Create a cluster using Cluster Toolkit](https://docs.cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/create/gke-ai-hypercompute#use-cluster-toolkit) for general instructions on other consumption options. Similar configuration settings can be used for GKE-A3M cluster as well.
