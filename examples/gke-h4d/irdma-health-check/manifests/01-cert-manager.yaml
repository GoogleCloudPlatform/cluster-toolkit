# cert-manager is a popular open-source tool for managing TLS certificates in Kubernetes.
# It can automatically provision certificates from various sources, such as Let's Encrypt,
# or self-signed issuers, and keep them up-to-date.
#
# For this webhook, cert-manager will create a self-signed certificate and automatically
# inject the CA bundle into the MutatingWebhookConfiguration.
#
# Please install cert-manager by following the official instructions:
# https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/
#
# For example, using kubectl:
# kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.11.0/cert-manager.yaml
