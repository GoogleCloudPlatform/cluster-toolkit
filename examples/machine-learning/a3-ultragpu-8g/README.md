# A3 Ultra Blueprints

## Slurm compute clusters
For further information on deploying an A3 Ultra cluster with Slurm, please
see:

[Create A3 Ultra Slurm Cluster](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/create/create-slurm-cluster)

### Cloud Storage FUSE

This blueprint includes four Cloud Storage FUSE mounts to provide a simple and scalable way
to manage data.

1. `/gcs` is a general purpose mount that can be used for shared tools and data.
1. `/gcs-checkpoints` is an optimized mount for writing and reading checkpoints. It
    uses the local SSD for caching and enables parallel downloads to improve
    performance.
1. `/gcs-training-data` is an optimized mount for reading training data. It can
   be further tuned if the training data fits fully within the local ssd
   storage.
1. `/gcs-model-serving` is an optimized mount for serving models, which
   downloads model weights in parallel to local ssd.

## VMs without scheduler

To test workloads directly on A3 Ultra VMs, you can deploy the [a3ultra-vm.yaml]:

- A configurable number of A3 Ultra VMs (default N=2)
- RDMA networking and GPU drivers pre-configured on our Ubuntu 22.04 Accelerator Image
- Additional software environment customization can be achieved by adding to the example startup-script

The VMs can be consumed from a reservation by modifying the `reservation_name` parameter in the `a3ultra-vms` module.

[a3ultra-vm.yaml]: ./a3ultra-vm.yaml

### Additional ways to provision
Cluster toolkit also supports DWS Flex-Start, Spot VMs, as well as reservations as ways to provision instances.

[For more information on DWS Flex-Start in Slurm](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit/blob/main/docs/slurm-dws-flex.md)
[For more information on Spot VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot)

We provide ways to enable the alternative provisioning models in the
`a3ultra-slurm-deployment.yaml` file.

To make use of these other models, replace `a3u_reservation_name` in the
deployment file with the variable of choice below.

`a3u_enable_spot_vm: true` for spot or `a3u_dws_flex_enabled: true` for DWS Flex-Start.
