The examples in this directory are used to show how enroot + pyxis can be used
to launch containerized workloads via Slurm.

Contents:

* `build-nccl-tests.sh`: A Slurm batch script for building the nccl-tests.
* `run-nccl-tests.sh`: A Slurm batch script for running the nccl-tests
  `all_reduce_perf` benchmark.
* `import_container.sh`: Uses enroot to create a squashfs container image. Added
  for reference only. enroot import happens within the `build-nccl-tests.sh`.

# Running NCCL-Tests via Enroot/Pyxis

In general the workflow to deploy GPUDirect-RDMA-enabled workloads via enroot-pyxis is
the following:

1. Convert your container into a squashfs based container image
2. Set required environment variables
3. Run your application workload

## TLDR

For an end-to-end example, copy the `build-nccl-tests.sh` and
`run-nccl-tests.sh` to your login node.

And run the following:

```text
BUILD_JOB=$(sbatch --parsable build-nccl-tests.sh) # takes ~4 minutes
sbatch -d afterok:${BUILD_JOB} run-nccl-tests.sh # takes ~3 minutes
```

The latter should result in a slurm-XX.out file that contains the result of the nccl
`all_gather_perf` benchmark:

```text
#

## Detailed Instructions

All of the following should be done on the login node of your slurm cluster,
and while somewhere on the shared Filestore filesystem (typically the user's
home directory).

### Building NCCL-tests

See build-nccl-tests.sh for an example. Within it, you will see that first we'll
create a squashfs version of the container using we want to launch using `enroot
import`. We do this because otherwise we'd be pulling the (typically more than
10GB) image multiple times from the source on each node, converting to sqsh each
time, etc, which would make the job launch longer.

For building the nccl-tests binaries, we use `pyxis` to run the enroot container
and build the nccl-tests within that container to ensure the resulting binarier
are compatible with the container environment.

Both of the above (importing and building) are accomplished by running:

```text
sbatch build-nccl-tests.sh
```

### Running your application on a3-ultra instances

For a complete example, run:

```text
sbatch run-nccl-tests.sh
```

The output will appear in in a `slurm-<job#>.log` file. If the name of your a3-ultragpu
partition is different than "a3ultra", you will need to modify the `build-nccl-tests.sh`
and `run-nccl-tests.sh` scripts's  `#SBATCH --partition` setting. Alternatively, you
can run `sbatch -p <your partition> <script>`.
