  # Private Service Access (PSA) requires the compute.networkAdmin role which is
  # included in the Owner role, but not Editor.
  # PSA is a best practice for Filestore instances, but can be optionally
  # removed by deleting the private_service_access module and any references to
  # the module by Filestore modules.
