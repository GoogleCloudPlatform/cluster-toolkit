# A4 High Blueprints

## A4-High Slurm Cluster Deployment
For further information on deploying an A4 High cluster with Slurm, please

## A4-High VMs

### Build the Cluster Toolkit gcluster binary

Follow instructions
[here](https://cloud.google.com/cluster-toolkit/docs/setup/configure-environment),
on how to set up your cluster toolkit environment, including enabling necessary
APIs and IAM permissions.

### (Optional, but recommended) Create a GCS Bucket for storing terraform state

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TF_STATE_BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket>
PROJECT_ID=<your-gcp-project>
REGION=<your-preferred-region>

gcloud storage buckets create gs://${TF_STATE_BUCKET_NAME} \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
    --default-storage-class=STANDARD --location=${REGION} \
    --uniform-bucket-level-access
gcloud storage buckets update gs://${TF_STATE_BUCKET_NAME} --versioning
```

### Obtain Filestore Zonal Capacity

We suggest using a filestore zonal instance for the best NFS performance, which
may require a quota increase request. See
[here](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/requesting-quota-increases) for
more information. The Slurm and VM blueprints below default to 10TiB (10240 GiB)
instances.

### Create/modify the deployment file with your preferred configuration

For example, set the such as size, reservation to be used, etc, as well as the
name of the bucket that you just created. Below are example contents for
`a4high-vm-deployment.yaml`.

```yaml
---
terraform_backend_defaults:
  type: gcs
  configuration:
    bucket: TF_STATE_BUCKET_NAME

vars:
  project_id: <PROJECT_ID>
  deployment_name: a4high-vm
  region: <REGION>
  zone: <ZONE>
  a4h_reservation_name: <RESERVATION_NAME>
  number_of_vms: <RESERVATION_SIZE>
```

### Additional ways to provision
Cluster toolkit also supports DWS Flex-Start, Spot VMs, as well as reservations as ways to provision instances.

[For more information on DWS Flex-Start in Slurm](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cluster-toolkit/blob/main/docs/slurm-dws-flex.md)
[For more information on Spot VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/spot)

We provide ways to enable the alternative provisioning models in the `a4high-slurm-deployment.yaml` file.

To make use of these other models, replace `a4h_reservation_name` in the deployment file with the variable of choice below.

`a4h_enable_spot_vm: true` for spot or `a4h_dws_flex_enabled: true` for DWS Flex-Start.

### Deploy the VMs

```bash
#!/bin/bash
./gcluster deploy -d a4high-vm-deployment.yaml a4high-vm.yaml --auto-approve
```
