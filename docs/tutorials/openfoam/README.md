# Cluster Toolkit - OpenFOAM Simulation and Visualization

Cluster Toolkit is an open-source software offered by Google Cloud which makes
it easy for customers to deploy HPC environments on Google Cloud.
[OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/) is a popular tool for running
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This
[demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scientific-computing-examples/tree/main/apptainer/demos/openfoam)
in the Google Cloud Platform scientific computing examples
[repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/scientific-computing-examples/tree/main)
walks you through the process of running and visualizing an OpenFOAM simulation
using a set of [apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) containers on a Slurm-based
HPC system deployed with the Cluster Toolkit.
