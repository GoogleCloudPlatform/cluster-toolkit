## Description

This module creates a startup script that will execute a list of runners in the
order they are specified. The runners are copied to a GCS bucket at deployment
time and then copied into the VM as they are executed after startup.

Each runner receives the following attributes:

- `destination`: (Required) The name of the file at the destination VM. If an
  absolute path is provided, the file will be copied to that path, otherwise
  the file will be created in a temporary folder and deleted once the startup
  script runs.
- `type`: (Required) The type of the runner, one of the following:
  - `shell`: The runner is a shell script and will be executed once copied to
    the destination VM.
  - `ansible-local`: The runner is an ansible playbook and will run on the VM
    with the following command line flags:

    ```shell
    ansible-playbook --connection=local --inventory=localhost, \
      --limit localhost <<DESTINATION>>
    ```

  - `data`: The data or file specified will be copied to `<<DESTINATION>>`. No
    action will be performed after the data is staged. This data can be used by
    subsequent runners or simply made available on the VM for later use.
- `content`: (Optional) Content to be uploaded and, if `type` is
   either `shell` or `ansible-local`, executed. Must be defined if `source` is
   not.
- `source`: (Optional) A path to the file or data you want to upload. Must be
  defined if `content` is not. The source path is relative to the deployment
  group directory. Scripts distributed as part of modules should start with
  `modules/` followed by the name of the module used (not to be confused with
  the module ID) and the path to the script. The format is shown below:

    ```text
    source: ./modules/<<MODULE_NAME>>/<<SCRIPT_NAME>>
    ```

  For more examples with context, see the
  [example blueprint snippet](#example). To reference any other source file, an
  absolute path must be used.

- `args`: (Optional) Arguments to be passed to `shell` or `ansible-local`
  runners. For `shell` runners, these will be passed as arguments to the script
  when it is executed. For `ansible-local` runners, they will be appended to
  a list of default arguments that invoke `ansible-playbook` on the localhost.
  Therefore`args` should not include any arguments that alter this behavior,
  such as `--connection`, `--inventory`, or `--limit`.

### Runner dependencies

`ansible-local` runners require Ansible to be installed in the VM before
running. To support other playbook runners in the HPC Toolkit, we install
version 2.11 of `ansible-core` as well as the larger package of collections
found in `ansible` version 4.10.0.

If an `ansible-local` runner is found in the list supplied to this module,
a script to install Ansible will be prepended to the list of runners. This
behavior can be disabled by setting `var.prepend_ansible_installer` to `false`.
This script will do the following at VM startup:

- Install system-wide python3 if not already installed using system package
  managers (yum, apt-get, etc)
- Install `python3-distutils` system-wide in debian and ubuntu based
  environments. This can be a missing dependency on system installations of
  python3 for installing and upgrading pip.
- Install system-wide pip3 if not already installed and upgrade pip3 if the
  version is not at least 18.0.
- Install and create a virtual environment located at `/usr/local/ghpc-venv`.
- Install ansible into this virtual environment if the current version of
  ansible is not version 2.11 or higher.

To use the virtual environment created by this script, you can activate it by
running the following command on the VM:

```shell
source /usr/local/ghpc-venv/bin/activate
```

You may also need to provide the correct python interpreter as the python3
binary in the virtual environment. This can be done by adding the following flag
when calling `ansible-playbook`:

```shell
-e ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/local/ghpc-venv/bin/activate
```

> **_NOTE:_** ansible-playbook and other ansible command line tools will only be
> accessible from the command line (and in your PATH variable) after activating
> this environment.

### Staging the runners

Runners will be uploaded to a
[GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets). This
bucket will be created by this module and named as
`${var.deployment_name}-startup-scripts-${random_id}`. VMs using the startup
script created by this module will pull the runners content from a GCS bucket
and therefore must have access to GCS.

> **_NOTE:_** To ensure access to GCS, set the following OAuth scope on the
> instance using the startup scripts:
> `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only`.
>
> This is set as a default scope in the [vm-instance],
> [SchedMD-slurm-on-gcp-login-node] and [SchedMD-slurm-on-gcp-controller]
> modules

[vm-instance]: ../../compute/vm-instance/README.md
[SchedMD-slurm-on-gcp-login-node]: ../../../community/modules/scheduler/SchedMD-slurm-on-gcp-login-node/README.md
[SchedMD-slurm-on-gcp-controller]: ../../../community/modules/scheduler/SchedMD-slurm-on-gcp-controller/README.md

### Tracking startup script execution

For more information on how to use startup scripts on Google Cloud Platform,
please refer to
[this document](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/startup-scripts/linux).

To debug startup scripts from a Linux VM created with startup script generated
by this module:

```shell
sudo DEBUG=1 google_metadata_script_runner startup
```

To view outputs from a Linux startup script, run:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u google-startup-scripts.service
```

### Example

```yaml
- id: startup
  source: ./modules/scripts/startup-script
  settings:
    runners:
      # Some modules such as filestore have runners as outputs for convenience:
      - $(homefs.install_nfs_client_runner)
      # These runners can still be created manually:
      # - type: shell
      #   destination: "modules/filestore/scripts/install_nfs_client.sh"
      #   source: "modules/filestore/scripts/install_nfs_client.sh"
      - type: ansible-local
        destination: "modules/filestore/scripts/mount.yaml"
        source: "modules/filestore/scripts/mount.yaml"
      - type: data
        source: /tmp/foo.tgz
        destination: /tmp/bar.tgz
      - type: shell
        destination: "decompress.sh"
        content: |
          #!/bin/sh
          echo $2
          tar zxvf /tmp/$1 -C /
        args: "bar.tgz 'Expanding file'"

- id: compute-cluster
  source: ./modules/compute/vm-instance
  use: [homefs, startup]
```

In the above example, a new GCS bucket is created to upload the startup-scripts.
But in the case where the user wants to reuse existing GCS bucket or folder,
they are able to do so by using the `gcs_bucket_path` as shown in the below example

```yaml
- id: startup
  source: ./modules/scripts/startup-script
  settings:
    gcs_bucket_path: gs://user-test-bucket/folder1/folder2
    install_cloud_ops_agent: true

- id: compute-cluster
  source: ./modules/compute/vm-instance
  use: [startup]
```
