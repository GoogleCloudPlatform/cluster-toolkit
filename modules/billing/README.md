# terraform-google-billing-budget

A [Terraform] module to manage [Google Billing Budgets](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets) on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com).

A budget enables you to track your actual Google Cloud spend against your
planned spend. After you've set a budget amount, you set budget alert
threshold rules that are used to trigger notifications such as email, slack and Pub/Sub.
