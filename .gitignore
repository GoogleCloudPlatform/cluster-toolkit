# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sentitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject
# to change depending on the environment.

*.tfvars
**/tf*.log

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override modules locally and so
# are not checked in
