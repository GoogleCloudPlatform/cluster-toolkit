A list of network interfaces for the VM instance. Each network interface is represented by an object with the following fields:

- network: (Optional) The name of the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network that this VM instance is connected to.

- subnet: (Optional) The name of the subnetwork within the specified VPC that this VM instance is connected to.

- nic_type: (Optional) The type of vNIC to be used on this interface. Possible values are: `VIRTIO_NET`, `GVNIC`.

- access_configs: (Optional) An array of access configurations for this network interface. The access_config object contains:
  * external_ip: (Required) An external IP address associated with this instance. Specify an unused static external IP address available to the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a static external IP address, it must live in the same region as the zone of the instance.
