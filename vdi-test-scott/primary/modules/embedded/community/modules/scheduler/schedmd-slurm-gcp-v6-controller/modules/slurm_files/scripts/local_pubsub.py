"""
Implementation of message queue that mimics interface of GCP (PubSub)[https://cloud.google.com/pubsub]

Messages are stored on controller state disk (to survive controller re-creation) with following layout:

/<controller_state_disk_mount>/<pubsub_folder>
├- <TOPIC>
|  └- <MESSAGE_ID>
└- .staging
   └- <TOPIC>
      └- <MESSAGE_ID>

One message is one immutable file, that will be deleted after acknowledgement.
NOTE: Implementation assumes that both `<TOPIC>` and `.staging/<TOPIC>` are on the same disk device,
so it can rely on atomic "move / rename" operation.
